[+] About API [+]
[-] I built this api a month or so ago because I wanted to learn and use JWT(Json Web token)
[-] I would not recommend using this for a public api... you would have to do alot of work to make is worthy of that.

[+] Requirements [+] 
[+] You will need a account over at mongodb link: https://account.mongodb.com/account/login
[+] Once you have done that you will need to open the index.js file and go to line 6
[+] After doing this you will need to go into your mongo db and select a free db to deploy.
[+] Once doing that and it has deployed you need to make sure to allow your ip address in the Network Access tab then go to the db you can do that by going down to the security tab once doing this press on the Database access
[+] Once doing that press on the connect button then press the to your application button.
[+] Copy the url it gives you there and paste it on line 6 in index.js
[+] In the url exchange the <username>:<password> with the username and password you gave the account access to the db.
[+] In your directory open a cmd and run npm i
[+] Once doing that you can start with nodemon in your directory open a cmd and run npm start

That should be all enjoy :)
